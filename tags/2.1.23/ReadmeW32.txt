This archive contains the Win32 build of the current release of the Model
Railroad System cross-built under CentOS 4 ix86.  It was build on a PIII
with the default i386 target. The binary distribution is in three
archives: Win32BinOnly, Win32BinDoc, Win32BinDevel archives.  The
Win32BinOnly archive contains the binary executables and support
libraries, the Win32BinDoc archive contains the built documentation
files (PDF and HTML), and the Win32BinDevel contains the files needed to
support development, including C++ headers and static libraries.

It has NOT be heavily tested (by me) under MS-Windows, since I don't
have a MS-Windows machine to test it on.  I have used wine to verify that
the executable files have basic functionallity. The executables don't
need to be installed anyplace in particular, since they are
self-contained Starpacks, containing all of their needed support files.
There is an installer program, named setup.exe, on the CD (or in the iso
file), that can be used to install both the base binary archives as well
as various additional packages (which includes the source code). The
installer program expects to be in the same directory as the archives it
installs.
