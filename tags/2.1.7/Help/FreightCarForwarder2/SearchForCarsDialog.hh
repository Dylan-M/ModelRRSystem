0 SearchForCarsDialog
This dialog box allows you to search for cars to view, edit, or delete. 
You start by giving a car number pattern, usually the first 3-5 digits
of a car number.  Then all cars with this car number as part of their
car number are listed.  You can then select one of the listed cars to
view, edit, or delete.
