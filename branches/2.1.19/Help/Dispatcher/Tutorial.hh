The Dispatcher program is used to create computerized CTC (Centeralized
Traffic Control) panels, to be used by dispatchers as part of a CATC
(Computer Assisted Traffic Control) system to manage traffic flow for a
model railroad.  A computerized CTC panel typically contains a trackwork
schematic and a collection of control elements (such as switch plates,
signal plates, toggle switches, push buttons, etc.) that control the
trackwork and trackside signals.  In addition to creating and editing
CTC panels, the Dispatcher program can read in an XTrkCAD layout file
and create a compressed graph of the trackwork and this graph can be
used as a guide while creating CTC panels.
