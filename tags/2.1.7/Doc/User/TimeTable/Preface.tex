\chapter{Preface}

This program was inspired by chapter 8 of the book {\it How to Operate
Your Model Railroad}\cite{Chubb77} by Bruce A. Chubb.  I strongly
recommend reading this chapter fully before using this program.  This program
implements the methods described in this chapter, in an automated fashion.
