\chapter{Resistor Program Reference}
\label{chpt:rest:Reference}
\typeout{$Id$}

The Resistor Calculator program aids in calculating dropping resistors
for LEDs and low-voltage lamps commonly used on model railroads.  It
implements Ohm's Law\index{Ohm's Law}, shown in
Equations~\ref{eq:rest:OhmsLaw} and~\ref{eq:rest:VDrop} to perform the
calculation and then finds the nearest stock value and also displays
the color bands for typical carbon resistors.

\begin{eqnarray}
R_{drop} &=& \frac{V_{drop}}{I} \label{eq:rest:OhmsLaw} \\
V_{drop} &=& V_{supply} - V_{load} \label{eq:rest:VDrop}
\end{eqnarray}

The calculator takes three input values, the supply voltage
($V_{supply}$), the voltage across the load ($V_{load}$) (LED or lamp)
and the load current ($I$) the LED or lamp operates at.  These values
are entered along with the units they are in. Then the calculate button
is pushed and the results are displayed.  The results can also be saved
to a text file, which can be printed or otherwise referred to later.
