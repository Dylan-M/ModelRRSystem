\chapter{Auto Dispatcher}
\label{chapt:AutoDispatcher}
\typeout{$Id$}

The software for this layout implements a simple automatic dispatching
system. Most of the time the trains are on a double track ``main line''
and require no dispatching, since each main line track segment is
operated in a single direction with only one train.  At the either end of the
layout is a segment of bi-directional single track.  Using 
Azatrax MRD2-U's the computer senses trains traveling through these
segments of bi-directional single track and uses Azatrax SR4-Us to
control the turnouts, signals, and the polarity of the power feed to the
segments of bi-directional single track, allowing only one train access
at a time.

Each segment of bi-directional single track, with associated turnouts
use two MRD2-U's (one for each logical direction) to sense trains.

\section{Dispatching Logic}

\end{centering}
\end{figure}
A schematic track diagram of a bi-direction single track segment is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AutoDispatcher:singletrack-ink1}. There are
four sensor locations, shown as white dots and labeled \texttt{Left 1},
\texttt{Left 2}, \texttt{Right 1}, and \texttt{Right 2}.  These sensors
are connected to two MRD2-U, \texttt{Left} and \texttt{Right}. The
sensors are connected to the MRD2-U such that a given MRD2-U's ``sense
1'' is the entry and ``sense 2'' is the exit.  Each MRD2-U device thus
senses a train going in a specific direction through the single track
segment. There is a gap (eg with insulating rail joiners) between both
mainline tracks and the single track segment.  There is an additional
gap about the length of the engine past the entrance sensor.  This short
segment of track is powered via diodes from the rest of the single track
segment. The diodes enforce the correct direction of travel for the
entering train. The single track segment is considered occupied by a train
traveling from right to left if either of the left sensors are active
(the train is entering or leaving) or if the left sensor 1 latch is set
(the train is between sensors).  The  single track segment is
considered occupied by a train traveling from left to right if either
of the right sensors are active (the train is entering or leaving) or
if the right sensor 1 latch is set (the train is between sensors). 
When a train arrives at a sensor 1 position (either \texttt{Left 1} or
\texttt{Right 1}), the computer checks to see if the single track
segment is occupied by a train going in the opposite direction.
