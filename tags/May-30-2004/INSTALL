Standard top-level text files


Throughout this file I will refer to the two 'reference' Linux systems
I use:  RH 7.3 (RedHat 7.3) and RH 6.2 (RedHat 6.2).  Right now I am
running RH 7.3 on my main desktop and I've not upgraded for a number of
reasons, mostly to avoid breaking some critical software.  I run RH 6.2
on my '486-based LapTop (upgrading beyond RH 6.2 is likely to be
problematical for this older machine).  RedHat 6.2 is also good as a
reference platform, since it is likely to be a more 'comfortable'
distribution for older systems, such as 486 based and early Pentiums
(P75 though P133 or so).  These are machines that are probably quite
sufficient to run all but the most elaborate model RR empires, esp. if
a mechanical CTC board is used.  Machines like this can be 'rescued'
from dumpsters (they can be had basically for free) and a 'low-end'
incarnation of Linux (such as RH 6.2) can be installed on these boxes.

To completely build the Model RR System, you will need:

bison++-1.21. The Mandrake RPM package bison++-1.21.8-1mdk.i586.rpm
installs under Redhat 7.3, and the bison++-1.21.7-2mdk.src.rpm package
can be rebuilt under RH 6.2.

Swig 1.1p5.  This package comes with RH 7.3 and there is a RPM available
for RH 6.2

LaTeX needs to be installed.  teTex come with both RH 7.3 and RH 6.2 --
you just need to be sure to install it.

Tcl/Tk 8.3 (or later).  Comes with RH 7.3.  You can download the source
tarballs from http://tcl.sourceforge.net/ and build them on RH 6.2 and
install them under /usr/local.  RH 6.2 comes with Tcl/Tk 8.0 installed
under /usr.  You will need to specify --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib on the
configure script to insure that the configure script picks up the 8.3
version.

Doc++ is used to create the C++ internals docs.  Doc++ is available on
the Web somewhere.  Download and build it.  Install it under
/usr/local/bin.

dvidvi is used to handle two sided printing.  You can skip this if you
want.  ps2pdf is used to convert the documents to PDF files.  ps2pdf is
part of the ghostscript package, which comes with all RedHat
distributions. 

In order for the configure scripts to work, you'll need to make sure
your PATH includes /usr/local/bin.

I'm also assuming that you have the g++, gcc, bintools, and the base
level *-devel packages installed, as well as make and autoconf (you
need these to build anything).

Once you have all of the various support software installed, you should
be able to enter these commands in the main directory (where this file
is):

./configure	('./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib' under RH 6.2)
make

And everything will be built.

Note that once you have done the configure at the top level, you can
skip to a selected sub directory and build there only.  For example:

./configure
cd Scripts
make
cd ..
cd C++/CMri
make


That is, you don't have to build *everything* if you don't need to.

Right now, the 'install' target is not completely implemented.  Don't
even try to do a 'make install'.  You should be able to run everything
right from the build directory.  You might need to set the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (should point at the Lib directory off the main
build tree) to use the shared libraries.
